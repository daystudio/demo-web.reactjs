# demo-web.reactjs

A web reactjs demo, same design aligned with other demo-web and demo-mobile projects.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.


### Installing - NPM

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Clone the project, and build with

```
npm install or npm i
```

### Run in development

Run with

```
npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Build for production

Run with

```
npm run build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
